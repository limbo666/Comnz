# Comnz

Comnz (*commands*) is a tray Windows utility.

It runs a UDP server which waits o receive specific commands from dedicated hardware and execute commands.

For instance you can remote trigger key combinations like **Ctrl+C (Copy), Ctrl+V (Paste).**

This allows user to create its own hardware keys to control common command on PC or execute programs remotely.

A lua script for Nodemcu (*firmware*) based ESP8266 based modules is provided as example to demonstrate the possibilities.
